## To-do List

✅ 1. The game has a startup screen that shows the name of the game, the values and images of the aliens, and has a Play Game and High Scores menu.  

✅ 2. The high scores are stored on disk, and are displayed when the menu is selected.

✅ 3. The game has three types of movable aliens, created using a pixel editor. 

❌ 4. A UFO alien moves across the screen at random, infrequent intervals. It was created using a pixel editor, and it shows its value when it is destroyed.

✅ 5. The ship was created using a pixel editor. It also has an animated (8-12 pixel frame) for destruction.

✅ 6. The aliens have simple, two-frame animations for movement. They also have a simple (3-4 frame) animation for destruction.

✅ 7. The aliens can shoot lasers back at the ship at infrequent, random intervals. Use a random number generator and pygame.time.get_ticks().

✅ 8. Bunkers allow the ship to hide from the aliens’ lasers, but they are damaged by aliens’ or ship’s lasers. Use the Python Imaging Library for pixel manipulation.

✅ 9. Ominous background music becomes faster as the number of aliens decrease. 

✅ 10. Pycharm IDE shows green checkmarks for every Python source file. 

✅ 11. Project directory pushed to new GitHub repository listed above. 

✅ 12. Project directory has been pushed using a GitHub client, not by manually dragging-and-dropping files onto the GitHub web page.
